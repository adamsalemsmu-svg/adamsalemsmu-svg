## 🧠 About Me

I’m a **Senior Business Intelligence Developer and Data Scientist** with over **five years** of experience turning data into actionable insights across healthcare and financial services. Based in Dallas–Fort Worth, TX, I hold an **M.S. in Business Analytics** from the **SMU Cox School of Business**. My career sits at the intersection of **data engineering**, **analytics** and **AI‑driven automation**—I love building scalable data solutions and uncovering signals that drive business growth.

Currently at **Lightbeam Health Solutions**, I transform clinical and operational data into dashboards and models that help healthcare organizations improve outcomes. Previously at **Elevate Bank**, I engineered data pipelines and predictive models that supported lending, credit‑risk and compliance teams. I thrive on bridging the gap between engineering and analysis and collaborating with diverse stakeholders to deliver high‑impact solutions.
